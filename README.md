##🍬 Sugar M8 – AI-Powered Glucose Insight & Forecasting for Type 1 Diabetes

Sugar M8 is an intelligent diabetes management platform designed to assist Type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients by providing real-time tracking, personalized predictions, and doctor-friendly insights.
Built with Streamlit, LightGBM, XGBoost, SHAP, and Google Gemini, it transforms raw glucose logs into meaningful, actionable health insights.

❤️ Why Sugar M8? — The Need for Better T1D Management

Managing Type 1 Diabetes is a 24/7 balancing act involving insulin dosing, carbohydrate intake, physical activity, and glucose monitoring. T1D patients face:

⚠️ Glucose volatility (rapid highs/lows)

🧩 Complex insulin–carb corrections

📉 Hypoglycemia risks, especially at night

📈 Long-term complications from prolonged hyperglycemia

🧠 Mental load from constant decision-making

Most apps track data, but very few help patients understand patterns or predict tomorrow’s glucose levels.
That's where Sugar M8 bridges the gap.
