 Why Sugar M8? — The Need for Better T1D Management

Managing Type 1 Diabetes is a 24/7 balancing act involving insulin dosing, carbohydrate intake, physical activity, and glucose monitoring. T1D patients face:

⚠️ Glucose volatility (rapid highs/lows)

 Complex insulin–carb corrections

 Hypoglycemia risks, especially at night

 Long-term complications from prolonged hyperglycemia

 Mental load from constant decision-making

Most apps track data, but very few help patients understand patterns or predict tomorrow’s glucose levels.
That's where Sugar M8 bridges the gap.
